This script is specifically useful when using the eldk cross-compiler from 
http://denx.de/

So far you've executed the wgets on this page: 
http://www.denx.de/wiki/ELDK-5/WebHome  
and you've run the install script sucessfully. Yay! Now all the 
binutils files you wanted are in some weird directory such as 
/opt/eldk-5.4/armv5te/sysroots/i686-eldk-linux/usr/bin/armv5te-linux-gnueabi/ .
Further, (this is particularly true if trying to compile u-boot) the code
you're compiling expects your tools to have names like arm-linux-gcc, 
while they actually have names like arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc.

This script takes those binutils programs that have just been installed and
creates synbolic links to them in a more convenient location with more 
expected names.
